( ndin ) announced today it has\r\nentered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its\r\nvoip products with lmb technologies inc . for the caribbean market which\r\nincludes bermuda .\r\nthe terms of the letter of intent include a 20 \% royalty payable to\r\nnomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales\r\nand other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration\r\npayable to nomad includes 20 \% of the common stock of lmb technologies\r\ninc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s\r\nmarket as soon as practicably possible .\r\nthe acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering into\r\na definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board\r\napprovals of lmb technologies inc . and nomad international inc .\r\npursuant to the proposed acquisition , on closing , lmb technologies inc .\r\nwould pay 2 o \% of its common stock to nomad international inc . as\r\nconsideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20 \% of the gross\r\nrevenues generated from any activities related to the license exclusive\r\nto the caribbean market .\r\n! \' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the\r\nopportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip\r\nservices over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution\r\nrelationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the\r\ncaribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,\r\nceo and chairman of nomad international inc .\r\nmay 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent\r\nannouncement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications\r\ncommission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol\r\n( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone\r\nservice .\r\nin its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build\r\nsustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers\r\nwill not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to\r\nstifle competition .\r\nthe ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter\r\nthe canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,\r\ncable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the\r\nmarket with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad\r\ninternational inc .\r\nthe key to nomad \' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its\r\nproducts to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though\r\nbroadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization\r\nworldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the\r\nu . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the\r\ntotal users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only\r\napproximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore\r\nrepresents approximately 8 o \% of the entire internet connectivity market .\r\nthe percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even\r\nhigher .\r\nnomad \' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service\r\nproviders not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,\r\nbut also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace\r\nby offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .\r\nabout nomad international inc .\r\nnomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications\r\ncompany developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over\r\ninternet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company \' s revolutionary voip\r\nproduct line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,\r\ncable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on\r\ntargeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in\r\neffectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace ,\r\n2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european\r\npresence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in\r\ntheir offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more\r\neconomical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a\r\nmeans of significantly lowering their communication expense with their\r\nrelatives in their country of origin .\r\nconclusion :\r\nthe examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known\r\ncompanies that explode onto investor \' s radar screens ; many of you are\r\nalready familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for\r\nyou ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch\r\nthis one trade monday ! go ndin .\r\npenny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable\r\nfor all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way\r\naffiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 30 oo dollars\r\nto distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and\r\nadvertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice .\r\nif you wish to stop future mailings , or if you feel you have been\r\nwrongfully placed in our membership , send a blank e mail with no thanks in\r\nthe sub ject to ournewsletter 24 @ yahoo . com\r\n',spam

'Subject: fw : meter 98 - 7266 ; may 2001 texas general land fuel volume\r\nfyi . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\r\nfrom : majorwitz , buddy\r\nsent : tuesday , october 23 , 2001 9 : 55 am\r\nto : olsen , michael\r\ncc : wynne , rita ; schumack , sherlyn\r\nsubject : meter 98 - 7266 ; may 2001 texas general land fuel volume\r\nmike ,\r\nas you may recall , this meter needs to be set up for may 2001 just as it was for april 2001 . below is a screen print of what april 2001 looks like . when you had previously attempted to set this meter up , i believe it wouldn \' t let you because of one ( or both ? ) of the contracts being canceled or expired . i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract ( s ) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system . as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel , i do not have a contact for you . hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past . since this is a call - out meter , i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may 2001 . in case you need to enter them , the volume should be as follows :\r\ncontract 012 - 41500 - 05 - 002 hpl injection 16 , 149\r\ncontract 012 - 88494 - 05 - 001 tx genl land withdrawal 16 , 149\r\ni have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible , therefore , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated . if you have any questions , please don \' t hesitate to give me a call .\r\nbuddy\r\nx - 31933\r\n',ham
