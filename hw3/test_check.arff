p\r\nas many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in\r\nprice because they are promoted , making a very large number of\r\ninvestors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp\r\nlet \' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\r\notc : dmxpp\r\nabout the company : p\r\ndelta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\r\ncompany that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\r\n( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\r\nlocated over what management considers to be some of the most\r\nprospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\r\nanother 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\r\ncontrolled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\r\nthat the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\r\nfound in north america . p\r\nthe management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\r\nrayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\r\ncompany to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\r\nexperience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\r\nmost successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\r\nthe president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\r\nmarket cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\r\nwith glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\r\nminerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\r\nalong with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\r\nextraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\r\nmoves forward . p\r\namong the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\r\nyears experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\r\nsouth america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\r\ncorp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\r\ndrilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p\r\ndelta has experienced significant technical success since its\r\nstart - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\r\nin - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\r\nkimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\r\nof the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\r\nthe three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\r\nminerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\r\ndiamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p\r\nan aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\r\ndiscover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\r\nunder - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\r\nkimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p\r\nin bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\r\nprospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\r\ngroup of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\r\none - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\r\nthe independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\r\ncomprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\r\nall the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\r\nexploration is justified . p\r\ndelta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\r\nits extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\r\nby acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\r\nidentifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\r\ncompanies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\r\nfinance additional exploration . p\r\nin addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\r\ncontrols , they also control a gold property with great potential .\r\nthe property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\r\nrevealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\r\nextensive exploration program . pp\r\n( source : company website ) p\r\nrecent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p\r\ndelta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a\r\nconference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p\r\ndelta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in\r\npreparation of work program . p\r\ndelta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold\r\nexploration findings in south america . p\r\ndelta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond\r\nexploration in south america . pp\r\nwill dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of\r\nthe stock this weekend and next week ?

'Subject: cleburne issues\r\ndaren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :\r\nnovember gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50\r\noctober payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00\r\ncleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50\r\nless : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )\r\nnet cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50\r\nper my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?\r\nadditionally , you \' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael \' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october \' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .\r\nplease advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .\r\njames',ham
